Welcome to the documentation of the e-Commerce Integration Program.

### Introduction
E-commerce platforms make it easy for webshops to manage incoming orders. 
By integrating e-commerce platforms with shipping software, webshops can also easily print labels and keep track of these orders. 
The MyParcel.com ecosystem already supports a variety of e-commerce platforms, but we are always looking to add more.
We have started the e-commerce integration program as an initiative to make it easy for third party developers to create an integration between e-commerce platforms and MyParcel.com.

### Getting Started
#### PHP Skeleton based on Laravel
We have created a Laravel-based [skeleton application](https://github.com/MyParcelCOM/integration-skeleton) for PHP developers.
This skeleton contains boilerplate for some functionality such as OAuth 2.0 authorization with Authorization Code flow and transforming shipment data to the requested format.
More information about this skeleton can be found in the readme on the [Github](https://github.com/MyParcelCOM/integration-skeleton) page.

To start working on the application using the skeleton, it is advised that you fork the repository.
