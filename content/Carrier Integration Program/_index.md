Welcome to the documentation of the Carrier Integration Program.

## Introduction

More and more developers are looking for ways to connect to different carrier services through one well documented and easy to use API. MyParcel.com has initiated the Carrier Integration Program to allow third party developers to add their own carrier integrations into the MyParcel.com carrier library. This library can be accessed for free by both developers and online sellers across the world.  

## Getting started

A carrier integration must be built as a standalone microservice. We have built a microservice skeleton that demonstrates the structure and setup of the microservice. It is accompanied by instructions to build the microservice faster. You can find the information [here](https://github.com/MyParcelCOM/microservice-skeleton).

## Interested?

If you are interested in adding a carrier to our library through a microservice, send us an e-mail (info@myparcel.com) or join our dedicated [Slack channel](https://join.slack.com/t/carrierlibrary/shared_invite/enQtMzE5MTgxNTA5NzMzLTdlN2FlZWQyZDMzYzlkZjhmMTI5ZmJkZTdjZWVhZWZjY2ZiM2E3N2JkMDdlMjIwY2E5MTNmM2I1MDc0MDc1NmM). The Slack channel is used by developers to share best practices and ask for help when needed.
