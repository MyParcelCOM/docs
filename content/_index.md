# Welcome

Welcome to the documentation for the MyParcel.com REST API.

## Getting Started
The quickest way to get started using our API is to implement our [PHP-SDK](/php-sdk). With just a few lines of code, you could be sending shipments using our platform.

Of course you can also talk to our API directly. For everything from authorization to each feature including a step by step guide, go [here](/api).

### Delivery Plugin
Aside from our core api, we have also developed a JavaScript plugin that allows you to easily implement choosing pickup locations in your checkout flow. It seamlessly integrates with our api and sdk.

### Contributing to the docs
If you notice anything missing or would like to propose an improvement to our documentation, do not hesitate to open an issue on our [Github repository](https://github.com/MyParcelCOM/docs).
