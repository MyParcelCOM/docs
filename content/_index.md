# Welcome

Welcome to the documentation for the MyParcel.com API and related software.

## Getting Started

The API uses an OAuth 2.0 server for authentication. If you do not already possess valid credentials, the first step is requesting them by sending us an [email](http://myparcel.com/contact/).

The quickest way to get started using our API is to implement our [PHP-SDK](/php-sdk). With just a few lines of code, you could be sending shipments using our platform. Of course, you can also send requests to our API directly. For everything from authentication to each feature including a step by step guide, read the [API chapter](/api) of these docs.

### Delivery Plugin

Aside from our API, we have developed a JavaScript plugin that allows you to easily implement choosing pickup locations in your checkout flow. It seamlessly integrates with our API and SDK.

### Contributing to the docs

If you notice anything missing or would like to propose an improvement to our documentation, do not hesitate to open an issue on our [Github repository](https://github.com/MyParcelCOM/docs).
