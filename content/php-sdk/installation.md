## Composer

The recommended way to install the SDK is by using [composer](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md).

```bash
composer require myparcelcom/api-sdk
```

## Github

If you do not use composer, you can download the latest release from the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/MyParcelCOM/api-sdk-php/releases). We do not recommend this method as you will have to set up your own auto-loading and you will have to manually update the SDK with each release.
