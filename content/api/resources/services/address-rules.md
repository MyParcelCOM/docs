Address rules are objects that contain a list of requirements for matching an address in order to be able to use this service.<br>
The address rules are used for the `regions_from` and `regions_to` attributes on the `service` resource.
They determine where a service can ship to and from, so if a service for instance can ship to England the value of the `country_code` will be `GB`.
