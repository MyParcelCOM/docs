<em class="fa fa-fw fa-file-text-o"></em>[API specification](https://docs.myparcel.com/api-specification#/Shops)

Every shop can have a unique name and settings like `return` and `billing` address. Most users might only have one shop used for all the shipments but if needed multiple shops can be created.
These shops can be used to specify for what shop your new [shipment](/api/resources/shipments/) was created.
